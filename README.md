The script first updates your system using the available package manager (either apt or dnf). It then checks if Flatpak is installed and installs it if necessary. Next, it adds the Flathub repository (if not already present) so that Flatpak can access a wide range of applications. Finally, it installs a predefined list of applications—such as Brave, Obsidian, HandBrake, Alpaca, MakeMKV, VLC, and Thunderbird—from Flathub.
